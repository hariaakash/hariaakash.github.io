Hello, I'm Hari, though you will often find me as Harinarayanan Sankaranarayan / Hari Aakash / yourcodechef / hariaakash. I currently live in London, England and am pursuing Masters in Computer Science at Queen Mary University of London. I'm generally interested in devops, backend development, geopolitics and startups.
